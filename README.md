1/ Download the dataset and unzip all datas
    
2/ Load all the files of UCI HAR Dataset folder that will be used to load data: 
test/subject_test.txt 
test/X_test.txt 
test/y_test.txt 
train/subject_train.txt 
train/X_train.txt 
train/y_train.txt

3/ Load activity, subject and feature info and read data from the files into the variables.

4/ Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set:
    Concatenate the data tables by rows.
    set names to variables.
    Merge columns to get the data frame merged_data for all data.

5/ Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
    Subset column names by measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
    Subset the data frame merged_data by selected column names and assign it to a new data frame extracted_data

6/ Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
    Read descriptive activity names from activity_labels.txt
    Factorize variable activity in the data frame extracted_data using descriptive activity names.

7/ Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names:
    Create a function that substitute:
      ^(t) by 'time'
      ^(f) by 'freq'
      -mean by 'Mean'
      -std by 'StdDev'
      BodyBody by 'Body'
      Mag by 'Magnitude'
    Apply the function to the column names of the data frame extracted_data

8/ Creates a independent tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject a
